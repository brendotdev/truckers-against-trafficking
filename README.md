# Truckers Against Trafficking â€” MERN Stack App

## Overview

**Truckers Against Trafficking** is a full-stack web application designed to empower truck drivers in the fight against human trafficking. By enabling real-time location-based incident reporting, community awareness, and educational resources, this platform gives drivers a voice and the tools to act when they witness suspicious activity.

## Inspiration

Inspired by the real-world initiative to engage truckers in anti-trafficking efforts, this project provides a digital platform for collective vigilance. It solves the problem of unreported trafficking observations by offering a secure, intuitive interface where drivers can submit and view incident data â€” no paperwork, no delays.

## Features

- **Live Incident Reporting**: Submit trafficking reports with location, description, and optional media.
- **Interactive Map View**: Visualize submitted reports based on geolocation.
- **Authentication**: Register and login system for added report traceability and safety.
- **Educational Resources**: Access curated content on how to recognize and respond to trafficking.
- **Upvote/Downvote System**: Surface the most relevant or urgent reports.
- **Sub-communities**: Filter reports by region, route, or trucking company (e.g., `r/I5Corridor` or `u/TruckSafeJoe`)
- **Dark Mode Toggle**: For long-distance night users.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for tablets, mobile devices, and in-cab browsers.
